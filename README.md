# cuda_sieveOfEratosthenes
implementation of sieve of eratosthenes in CUDA
I have used explicit memory model, unified memory model and unified memory with prefetch to try optimizing the program.

You can play with the code and further modify it :)


## to run the program 

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Open google colab 
3. import the CUDAProgram-sieve.ipynb file in google colab 
4. Finally , run it.
